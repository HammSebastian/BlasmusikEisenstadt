# Angular Component Code Quality Assessment

## Rating: 4/10

**Justification:** The codebase uses some modern Angular features like signals but fails to implement many Angular 20 best practices such as standalone components, OnPush change detection, and computed signals. The components have poor error handling, excessive non-null assertions, and lack accessibility considerations.

# Angular Component Improvement Tasks

## High Priority

- [ ] Convert all components to standalone components
- [ ] Implement OnPush change detection strategy for all components
- [ ] Replace traditional @Input decorators with input() signals
- [ ] Remove non-null assertions (!.) from templates
- [ ] Add proper error handling for HTTP requests in DataService
- [ ] Implement computed() signals for derived state
- [ ] Fix inconsistent method naming in DataService (loadEventsData vs getLocationById)
- [ ] Add proper type safety throughout the application
- [ ] Implement proper accessibility attributes (aria-labels, roles)

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Refactor event-details component to use computed signals for derived values
- [ ] Implement proper date formatting in templates
- [ ] Add responsive design considerations for mobile devices
- [ ] Extract inline styles to component CSS files
- [ ] Add loading state for iframe and images
- [ ] Implement error handling for missing images
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to methods and classes
- [ ] Implement caching strategy for API responses
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed HTTP requests

## Low Priority

- [ ] Refactor Loading and ErrorMessage components to be more configurable
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for images
- [ ] Add animation transitions between loading/error/content states
- [ ] Create shared styles for common UI elements
- [ ] Implement unit tests for components
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Create custom error handling service
- [ ] Implement logging service for debugging
- [ ] Add internationalization support
