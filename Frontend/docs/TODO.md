# Angular Component Code Quality Assessment

## Rating: 8/10

**Justification:** The codebase now implements modern Angular 20 best practices including standalone components, OnPush change detection, and computed signals. Components have proper error handling, accessibility improvements, and follow consistent naming conventions. The DataService has been enhanced with retry logic and caching for improved reliability and performance.
