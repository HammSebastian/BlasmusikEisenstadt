feat: Initial setup of Blasmusik Eisenstadt web application

This commit establishes the foundation for the Blasmusik Eisenstadt web application with both frontend and backend components:

Frontend:
- Set up Angular project structure with core modules and components
- Create data models for members, events, and other domain objects
- Add enums for event types, instruments, and sections
- Include initial assets (logos, images) for the organization
- Implement routing and layout components

Backend:
- Develop Java Spring Boot backend with entity models
- Create REST API endpoints with request/response DTOs
- Implement service layer for business logic
- Set up configuration for API documentation

This initial implementation provides the core functionality for managing:
- Organization members and their details
- Various event types (concerts, gigs, serenades)
- About section and news content

The application will serve as a comprehensive management system for the Blasmusik Eisenstadt organization.
